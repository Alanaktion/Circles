## Circles

Circles is a simple HTML5 game to demonstrate the basics of CSS3 and the HTML5 Cache Manifest in the context of mobile devices.  The game also works on modern desktop browsers.

Note: if you are not using Apache, or your server does not allow the Content-type header to be controlled by a .htaccess file, you will need to find some other way of making sure the file "circles.appcache" is sent with the content type "application/cache-manifest".
